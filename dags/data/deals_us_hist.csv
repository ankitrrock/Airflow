Hello Silviu,&nbsp;I hope you had a great weekend.&nbsp; Yes, I believe we have been crossing paths for a long time.&nbsp; It’s great to see you are also on the Geothermal journey, I’m really excited to see that to come to fruition.I will be going to ATCE next week and will be sure to set aside some time to chat with you.&nbsp; When does your schedule have some room to meet?&nbsp; I am currently booked Monday and Tuesday at lunch.&nbsp;Looking forward to chatting next week.&nbsp;Cheers,&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesse Powell BScEmerging Markets StrategistNCS Multistage, LLCncsmultistage.com&nbsp;| 403.801.4946 |&nbsp;jessep@ncsmultistage.comThe information contained in this communication is&nbsp;confidential and privileged.
